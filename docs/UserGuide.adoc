After the initial input is processed by the programme, user may encounter a maximum of four prompt windows for further input, including:

* A prompt window where user is required to choose the correct patient to schedule for, if the name provided in the initial input can be matched to multiple patients in the record. Patient ID of the intended patient is to be entered.
* A prompt window where user is required to provide a specific time slot for the appointment, from a list of available time periods, in DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm - hh:mm format.
* A prompt window where user may choose to provide any additional notes for the appointment.
* A prompt window where user may choose to provide any tags for the appointment.

Example:

Command entered: `add appointment for Xinze tomorrow`
// we require explicit numbering because the numbering system stops searching for further indices past
// a fenced code block.

2) Once `Xinze` is matched to a unique patient in the patient record, the program will display a list of available time periods during `tomorrow`, based on the current time at which the command is executed, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Time Slot
