*Command Format*

.   Commands are, in general, case sensitive.
.   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user, eg. in `add patient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
.   Items in square brackets are optional. +
    e.g. `make appointment [at 3pm] [next week]` may be entered as `make appointment`, and the program will prompt for the details as required.
.   Parameters may be specified in any order, eg. `make appointment next week at 3pm` is also acceptable for the abovementioned command.
====

In some places in this guide, you will find that two or more commands have been placed within curly brackets and separated by forward-slashes. This indicates that the commands are equivalent. For example, `{schedule/make} appointment` indicates that `schedule appointment` and `make appointment` are both equally valid.
