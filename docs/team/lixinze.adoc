== 1. Overview

This Project Portfolio is used to document the role and contribution of `LI XINZE` to this project, `Patient Book`.

The project `Patient Book` is a student project done by 5 NUS Year 2 Computer Science students. I am one member of
this project team, `T12-2` of AY2018-19 Semester 1. In this team, I am in charge of the User Interface (UI), including
the design, the function and the connection between UI and other components.

The project `Patient Book` is a desktop application for doctors. It is an all-in-one software that helps doctors to
manage patient and appointment data. In addition, it assists doctor to make diagnosis by providing information of
symptoms, diseases and drugs. The user interacts with it using a `Command Line Interface` (CLI), which means users can
enter all the commands by typing. It also has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

There is a list of main features. TODO

== 2. Summary of contributions

*This section records the enhancements and contributions of `LI XINZE` to the project.*

* *Major enhancement *: added the *appointment management mode* and the *switching feature between different modes*
** What it does: Allows appointment related data to be displayed. Allows users to switch between the patient management
mode and the appointment management mode. Helps the users to switch the mode automatically when they key in the command
in the wrong mode.
** Justification: This feature significantly improves the product because user can clearly separate the data of patients
and data of appointments by using the respective mode. The auto-switching feature contributes to the user-friendliness
of the product.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds an entire set of UI on top of the original implementation.
It required an in-depth understanding of the work flow of UI and how it can be linked to other components.
The auto-switching implementation was challenging as it required enhancement on each command related to patient or
appointment without breaking the existing functionality.

* *Minor enhancement 1*: added a `prompt window` that allows the application to acquire additional information from users
(if needed) during appointment addition. The prompt window is a general feature and hence can be used in other means if
there will be any further enhancements.

* *Minor enhancement 2*: added a `person browse panel` for `patient management mode` and a `appointment
browse panel` for `patient management m to replace the original `display panel`. The patient information and appointment notes can be displayed
accordingly without accessing the Internet.

* *Minor enhancement 3*: added `select command` which supports the CLI functionality of the product. Select command allows
users to select any patient card or appointment card without actually clicking the card.
