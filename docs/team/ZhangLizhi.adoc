=== Add an appointment : `add appointment`

*Format:* `add appointment for NAME DATE/DURATION`

Creates a new appointment and places it in the schedule. If necessary, switches the application to appointment management mode.

[NOTE]
Unlike other commands, this command does not require any prefixing.

For `DATE/DURATION` parameter, user may choose to use natural expressions to indicate the time or period where the appointment is to be scheduled. The list of natural expressions for `DATE/DURATION`
which are accepted by the program include:

* `tomorrow` or `tmr`
* `the day after tomorrow` or `the day after tmr`
* `in * day` or `in * days`
* `in * week` or `in * weeks`
* `in * month` or `in * months`
* `this week` or `next week`
* `this month` or `next month`
* `this Monday` `this Tuesday` `this Wednesday` `this Thursday` `this Friday` `this Saturday` or `this Sunday`
* `next Monday` `next Tuesday` `next Wednesday` `next Thursday` `next Friday` `next Saturday` or `next Sunday`
* `soon`
* `recently`
* `in a few days`
* in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
[NOTE]
Asterisk (*) denotes any positive integer number.

After the initial input is processed by the programme, user may encounter a maximum of four prompt windows for further input, including:

* A prompt window where user is required to choose the correct patient to schedule for, if the name provided in the initial input can be matched to multiple patients in the record. `Patient_ID` of the intended patient is to be entered.
* A prompt window where user is required to provide a specific time slot for the appointment, from a list of available time periods, in `DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm - hh:mm` format.
* A prompt window where user may choose to provide any additional notes for the appointment.
* A prompt window where user may choose to provide any tags for the appointment.

Example:

Command entered: `add appointment for Xinze tomorrow`
// we require explicit numbering because the numbering system stops searching for further indices past
// a fenced code block.

1) There are multiple individuals named `Xinze` in the patient record, the program will request for a specific patient ID in a form similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Patient ID

2) Once `Xinze` is matched to a unique patient in the patient record, the program will display a list of available time periods during `tomorrow`, based on the current time at which the command is executed, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Time Slot
image::promptTimeSlot.png[width="600"]

3) User further input: `31/10/2018 9:30 - 10:30`. Program proceeds to request for tags to be attached to the appointment, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Tags
image::promptTag.png[width="600"]

4) User may choose to provide or not provide any tags. In this case, the user does not wish to attach any tags. After that, program proceeds to request for additional notes for the appointment, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Additional Notes
image::promptNotes.png[width="600"]

5) User may choose to provide or not provide any additional notes. In this case, the user does not wish to add any additional notes. Upon completion, program creates the appointment as indicated in the schedule, and displays the following message to the user:


```
New appointment added: Appointment ID: e3 scheduled for patient ID: p7 during: 31/10/2018 09:30 to 31/10/2018 10:30
